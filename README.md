## Introduction 
The Right iPhone is a program that will allow users to choose the specific type, model, and memory of iPhone that is available on the market, search for the prices on different websites, and compile all this information together for the user to observe. 

Within the repository, you will find the following files:
- Documents - The Final Right-iPhone Report 
- Software
   - GUI_Design - GUI resources needed for Tkinter Python library 
   - Pictures - iPhone pictures for selection menu
   - The Right iPhone (python file) - Main Python file 

## Motivation
Each iPhone type has its own set of models and each model has its own set of memory. Selecting a specific iPhone combination is such a trivial task that should be easier. The Right iPhone’s GUI makes it easy for users to view and select the different combinations for searching.   

Apart from selecting the right iPhone with specific configuration, we all want the best possible product at the cheapest price, especially when it is something as expensive as an iPhone. The Right iPhone automatically searches prices on different websites and compiles the data together which saves user's time.

1. Download and install Anaconda - Python 3.7 or 3.8
2. Create a python environment by running "conda create -n RightiPhone python=3.8"
3. Activate the python environment by running "conda activate RightiPhone"
